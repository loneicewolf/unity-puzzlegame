# unity-puzzlegame
A free, open-source, Unity puzzle game! Inspired by various other games, such as Talos Principle, Cypher, Alchemia, and more.


⚠️ NOTE ⚠️
what I mean by "open source" is not by 100% code, as of course.. I am using Unity to make this game, but the project files (and the contents **before compilation**) will be **open source**.
That is, this game is made in Unity but will be as "open" and as "free" as possible. For just making it better(aka, more fun)

Since this is a puzzle game I thought that this is important. 

- `over and out! //Will.`
